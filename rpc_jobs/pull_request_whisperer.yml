      Thank you for submitting a pull request to this project!

      Once all `check` jobs have passed and the pull request has received a
      sufficient number of reviews, the repository's `gate` jobs can be triggered by
      adding a comment of `:shipit:` to this pull request.

      Note that the `CIT/Release` job is not a check job, so it will stay in `Expected`
      state until the release job is started with the `:shipit:` comment. 

      When the `gate` jobs have completed successfully, this pull request will get
      merged automatically.
