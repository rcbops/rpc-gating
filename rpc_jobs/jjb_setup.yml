# This job is specified as `freestyle` as using a pipeline job with github
# trigger causes the job to be triggered irrespective of which branch was
# pushed to.  Additionally, the environment variables we were trying to use to
# determine the branch to pushed to were not being passed into the job by the
# plugins in question.
# Also, having a separate merge trigger job ensures that JJB still runs on
# pushes to master, even if the JJB job is used to test an alternative branch.
