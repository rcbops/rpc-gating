# How to use this playbook..
# 1. Make sure you can ssh to the phobos deployment host manually.
#   Bastion config steps can be found in https://rpc-openstack.atlassian.net/browse/RE-643?focusedCommentId=170362&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-170362
# 2. Get the private key from passwordsafe and store it in id_rsa_webhookproxy (or store it somewhere else and override deploy_host_private_key_file with -e)
# 3. Run the playbook ansible-playbook phobostunnel.yml -i deploy_phobos.inv
